            "Your phone is rapidly jumping between different tower zones",
            "Normally your phone stays in one zone unless you're moving. Rapid back-and-forth switching can mean an attacker is forcing your phone to re-register, which reveals your location. Think of it like someone repeatedly ringing your doorbell to confirm you're home."

            "CID",
            "Cell ID — the unique identifier for a specific cell tower",

            "Mobile Country Code — identifies which country a network belongs to",

            "Newer networks (4G, 5G) have stronger encryption. Attackers can force your phone to use 2G/3G, which has weaker or no encryption, making it easier to eavesdrop on your calls and texts."

            "Handover",
            "Your phone switching from one cell tower to another",

            "Your phone calling out for WiFi networks it remembers",
